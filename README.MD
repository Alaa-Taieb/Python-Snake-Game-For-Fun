# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake Game created using the Pygame library in Python. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without running into the walls or the snake's own body. As the snake grows longer, it becomes more difficult to avoid collisions and the game gets progressively harder.

This game was created as a test of Python programming skills, and is intended to be used as a learning resource for beginners. The code is well-commented and easy to understand, making it a great starting point for anyone interested in game development with Python.

## Requirements

This program requires Python 3.x and the Pygame library to be installed on your machine. You can install Pygame using pip:

```
    pip install pygame
```

## How to Play

To play the game, simply run the `game.py` file using Python. The game will start immediately, and you can use the arrow keys to move the snake around the screen. The snake will move in the direction of the arrow key you press, and will continue moving in that direction until you press another arrow key.

The game ends when the snake hits the wall or its own body. If you hit the wall or your own body, you can press the "C" key to restart the game, or the "Q" key to quit.

## Customization

You can customize some aspects of the game by modifying the constants at the top of the `game.py` file. For example, you can change the size of the game window, the speed of the snake, and the colors used in the game.

## Credits

This game was created by [Your Name Here] as a test of Python programming skills. It is based on the classic Snake Game, which was first introduced in the late 1970s on arcade machines.

The Pygame library used in this game is an open-source library for Python that provides functionality for game development, and was created by a community of developers.
